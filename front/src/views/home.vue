            <p>If it were up to teachers, the curriculum would probably be updated every couple months or so. (But this can certainly be a complicated process, and many programs only make major changes every couple years). Generally the databases included in coding curriculums are dependent on current “trends” (with mixed reviews on who determines these trends), ease of use, and functionality relative to the real world. </p>

            <p>Smaller / shorter programs that don’t require modeling tend to use MongoDB, while larger / longer programs tend to use PostgreSQL because you can do more with it. </p>

            <p>Over the last several months, I’ve been doing qualitative research into the coding school / developer education space. Specifically investigating <strong>if, how, and why coding programs incorporate databases into their curriculum</strong>. While there were of course some differences based on location, size, and emphasis, there were also a few interesting commonalities. I thought I’d share my findings, see if the community has additional insight, and highlight where HarperDB might fit into the mix. <em>(Note: this is related to frontend and full stack programs since backend programs focus almost entirely on databases.)</em></p>

            Findings
            </h1>

            <p>To conduct this research I reached out to numerous coding instructors, educators, and students across the U.S. and Canada. While many people were respectively too busy, several folks were generous enough to share a bit of insight via email or hop on a call to have a more in depth discussion (if those folks are reading this - thanks again for your help!). I learned the following insights: </p>

            <ul>
            <li><strong>In general, most coding bootcamps, programs, or classes do touch on databases.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p>The extent or time spent on databases as well as the variety of databases included depends on the length of the program as well as size - <em>no surprise here</em>. While the larger programs might have more time to touch on databases, they may not have the flexibility to deviate from or influence the course catalog. Whereas smaller programs tend to have more flexibility to switch up the curriculum instead of having to “cut through red tape” to make a change. </p>

                <li><p>“I could see the HarperDB advantage of not having to change much of the program to cover what we do, no intermediary necessary.” </p></li>
                <li><p>“If HarperDB has parallels to Mongo and is more approachable, maybe this could be an alternative… a good way to show what a REST is, then build your own API, and incorporate SQL as needed.”</p></li>
